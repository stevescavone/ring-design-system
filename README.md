# Gettings Started

At Ring, we believe in design that transcends aesthetics. **Our design starts with our highest hope of our neighbors' experience.**

**Designing a neighbor experience is not an ordinary user experience or interface design.** It’s a day-to-day experience with your loving family. It’s a borderless experience whether you're at home, work or even in foreign countries. It's a community experience where you can share your stories with hundreds and thousands in your neighborhood.

**Ring Design System** is our small step to transcribe what we have learned, are learning, and will learn from our neighbors.

## Principles

### Usability

* Be mindful of neighbor's unpredictable environment such as slow internet speed and large estate.
* Be mindful of neighbor's unfamiliarity with technology as most of our users are the first adopter of technology.
* Be mindful of neighbor's unperceptive nature to learn something new as most of our users are already too busy. \(i.e. we can't make them think twice.\)

### Scalability

* Always be prepared to scale internationally with regulation and translation.
* Always be prepared to support all client types - iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Web.
* Always be prepared to accommodate for all verticals at Ring - Ring HQ, Alarm and Neighborhood.

### Adaptability

* A feature design process should anticipate multiple iterations based on feedback from multiple points.
* All user interface components are encouraged to be broken and experimented to meet any designer's needs.
* All user interface or experience should be adaptable for a variety of feature types. \(e.g. butterbars and snackbars\)

### TLDR;

* **Don't be too cute.**
* **Break and experiment with the existing user interface components.**
* **Don't forget the edge cases of different screen sizes and text length per translation. **
